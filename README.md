# Generation_of_summaries

# This script allows for the automated generation of summaries from conversations, providing flexibility in choosing between different AI models for the task. It follows a structured approach, including clear instructions for generating summaries and handling different summary types


This code is a Python script that aims to generate summaries from conversations. Let's break down its components:

# Imports: The script starts by importing necessary libraries like os, json, boto3, OpenAI, and dotenv. These libraries are used for various tasks such as accessing environment variables, handling JSON data, interacting with AWS services like S3 and Lambda, and using OpenAI's API for natural language processing.

# Function Definitions:
> get_completion: This function interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses to given prompts using the specified model.
> invoke_mistral: This function invokes a custom model deployed on AWS Lambda called Mistral, passing a prompt and receiving a response.
> generate_summary: This function generates a summary from a given conversation list using either the OpenAI model or the Mistral model, depending on the user's choice.
> generate_summary_prompts: This function generates prompts for generating summaries based on the conversation text, summary type, and username.

# Main Logic:
The main logic of the script revolves around generating prompts based on the conversation text, summary type, and username, and then using either the OpenAI or Mistral model to generate a summary.

# Summary Generation:
The generated summary is returned in a specific response format containing the username and the summary itself, enclosed in square brackets.

# Error Handling:
Error handling is implemented, particularly in the invoke_mistral function, where it catches any client errors and logs them.

# Overall, this script allows for the automated generation of summaries from conversations, providing flexibility in choosing between different AI models for the task. It follows a structured approach, including clear instructions for generating summaries and handling different summary types.
